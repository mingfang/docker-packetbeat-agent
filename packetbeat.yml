################### Packetbeat Configuration Example #########################

# This file contains an overview of various configuration settings. Please consult
# the docs at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/_configuration.html
# for more details.

# The Packetbeat shipper works by sniffing the network traffic between your
# application components. It inserts meta-data about each transaction into
# Elasticsearch.

############################# Shipper ############################################
shipper:

 # The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
 # all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
 # If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
 name:

 # The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
 # transaction published. Tags make it easy to group transactions by different
 # logical properties.
 #tags: ["service1"]

 # Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
 # by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
 # to remove duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers.
 ignore_outgoing: true

############################# Sniffer ############################################

# Select the network interfaces to sniff the data. You can use the "any"
# keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
interfaces:
 device: any
 type: af_packet
 buffer_size_mb: 100

############################# Protocols ######################################
protocols:
  http:

    # Configure the ports where to listen for HTTP traffic. You can disable
    # the http protocol by commenting the list of ports.
    ports: [80, 8080, 8000, 5000, 8002]

    # Uncomment the following to hide certain parameters in URL or forms attached
    # to HTTP requests. The names of the parameters are case insensitive.
    # The value of the parameters will be replaced with the 'xxxxx' string.
    # This is generally useful for avoiding storing user passwords or other
    # sensitive information.
    # Only query parameters and top level form parameters are replaced.
    # hide_keywords: ['pass', 'password', 'passwd']

    send_request: true
    split_coookie: true
    real_ip_header: "X-Forwarded-For"
    send_all_headers: true

    send_response: true
    include_body_for: ["application/json"]

  mysql:

    # Configure the ports where to listen for MySQL traffic. You can disable
    # the MySQL protocol by commenting out the list of ports.
    ports: [3306]

  pgsql:

    # Configure the ports where to listen for Pgsql traffic. You can disable
    # the Pgsql protocol by commenting out the list of ports.
    ports: [5432]

  redis:

    # Configure the ports where to listen for Redis traffic. You can disable
    # the Redis protocol by commenting out the list of ports.
    ports: [6379]

  thrift:

    # Configure the ports where to listen for Thrift traffic. You can disable
    # the Thrift protocol by commenting out the list of ports.
    ports: [9090]

  mongodb:
    # Configure the ports where to listen for Mongodb traffic. You can disable
    # the Mongodb protocol by commenting out the list of ports.
    ports: [27017]

############################# Output ############################################

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by packetbeat.
# You can enable one or multiple outputs by setting enabled option to true.
output:

  # Elasticsearch as output
  # Options:
  # host, port: where Elasticsearch is listening on
  # save_topology: specify if the topology is saved in Elasticsearch
  elasticsearch:
    enabled: true
    hosts: ["packetbeat:9200"]
    save_topology: true

  # Redis as output
  # Options:
  # host, port: where Redis is listening on
  # save_topology: specify if the topology is saved in Redis
  #redis:
  #  enabled: true
  #  host: localhost
  #  port: 6379
  #  save_topology: true

  # File as output
  # Options:
  # path: where to save the files
  # filename: name of the files
  # rotate_every_kb: maximum size of the files in path
  # number of files: maximum number of files in path
  #file:
  #  enabled: true
  #  path: "/tmp/packetbeat"
  #  filename: packetbeat
  #  rotate_every_kb: 1000
  #  number_of_files: 7

############################# Processes ############################################

# Configure the processes to be monitored and how to find them. If a process is
# monitored than Packetbeat attempts to use it's name to fill in the `proc` and
# `client_proc` fields.
# The processes can be found by searching their command line by a given string.
#
# Process matching is optional and can be enabled by uncommenting the following
# lines.
#
#procs:
#  enabled: false
#  monitored:
#    - process: mysqld
#      cmdline_grep: mysqld
#
#    - process: pgsql
#      cmdline_grep: postgres
#
#    - process: nginx
#      cmdline_grep: nginx
#
#    - process: app
#      cmdline_grep: gunicorn
